# Kontrolo for Forge

A simple QoL mod for Minecraft Forge

## About

Adds a GUI to quickly access common commands. Currently supports weather setting and common time set commands.

Please note that the buttons will give command errors if you don't have permission to use cheats.

The mod is client side only but should work on servers and Realms.

When you press one of the buttons, it sends the command for you. This is why you need cheat permissions and the mod
doesn't need to be added on the serverside.

## Required APIs
